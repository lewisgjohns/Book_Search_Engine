# Book_Search_Engine
This book search engine allows users to explore and save books with a simple, interactive interface. On loading the app, users see a menu with options to search for books or log in/sign up. If not logged in, users can still search for books, with each result displaying the title, author, description, cover image, and a link to Google Books. After signing up or logging in via a modal, users gain access to additional options: viewing saved books and logging out. Logged-in users can save books from search results to their account and view or remove saved books anytime. The Logout button reverts the menu to its original options.
